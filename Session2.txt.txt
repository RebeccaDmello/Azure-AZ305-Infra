Topics:
Compute
Storage (non-relational)
Storage (relational)
Data Integration

Case Study: Design a Compute Solution (PaaS solution)
Instructor Solu => Internet -> Application GW -> App Services (Frontend) -> Function Apps (middle tier) -> SQL Database (Back-end tier)
(IaaS)
Internet -> LB -> VM Scale sets -> LB - VM scale sets -> LB - > SQL ->(active directory)  Cloud witness

*** Design a non-relational data storage solution
- Structured data includes relational data and has a shared schema (cosmosdb - texts, SQLdb)
- Semi-structured is less organized than structured data and isn't in a relational format
- Unstructured data is the least orga type of data(Blobs, Files). Three types of Blob storage (block, page, appended)

*** Design for Azure storage accounts
- Storage account is kind of security boundary

Determine the best storage account type
- Account Type = standard general-purpose v2, premium block blobs, premium file shares, page blobs
- Supported service = Blobs/Data lake, queues, tables, azure files, Blob storage, Data lake, Azure files, page blobs 

*** Design for data redundancy
- Durability => 
Select a storage replication strategy
- Primary Region => Locally redundant storage, Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
- Secondary Region => Geo-redundant storage, Geo-zone redundant storage (LRS)
